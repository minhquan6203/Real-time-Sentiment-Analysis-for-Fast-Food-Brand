859321269555375_1001402474687126,KFC,The Chicken  do not look like that at our KFC  anymore  nor does it taste good anymore
859321269555375_2439446119576883,KFC,Just bought the Tuesday 10 piece bucket. Got home only 8 pieces. Tried to call no answer. MSG box full. Ck your to go orders before you leave here. I got shorted and could not reach anyone. I’m done with businesses that don’t honor their offers
859321269555375_428728783271688,KFC,Chambersburg KFC stated it has to be ordered on line to get the Tuesday deals.  Said thank you and drove out of the drive thru.  Went to Popeyes up the street.
859321269555375_443277768325287,KFC,Looks nothing like that when you get it
859321269555375_394041866950334,KFC,"The last 2 times I have eaten it, it was too salty. Wish they would cut down on that a little"
859321269555375_425465623704835,KFC,That's a 20 piece bucket
859321269555375_453099657301300,KFC,"My dad used to take us to kfc on Sunday’s and he could buy a full bucket, drinks and fries for the 5 of us for about $ 15.00 and even after eating a lot we would have left overs!! It’s crazy how small and dinky their chicken is nowadays!! Over priced too!"
859321269555375_850388630442557,KFC,"Those buckets are misleading. You don’t get that much. Back in the day, those buckets were packed full"
859321269555375_962366312041286,KFC,"That's an easy rule to comply with. I'm in no rush to eat dark meat chicken. Thus, pro tip#2, women and children first."
859321269555375_1927088541060235,KFC,Ashland Va didn't Honor it.  I will never go there again
859321269555375_681000447488242,KFC,I’ve had it three times. First time was 2 breast and 2 thighs and 2 legs. It was great. The other times they tried to screw me with a bunch of legs and wings 😡
859321269555375_428045840019413,KFC,Tried it last night. 8 pieces for $10 is a pretty good deal. Got home and the bucket had 4 drumsticks and 4 thighs. No breasts or wings. Your big TV ad didn't mention that. Last time I'll  buy from KFC.
859321269555375_444246561884150,KFC,Never get pieces of chicken like that and never any breast like we used to get. All you get now is minute legs and a wing with a smallest piece of breast. Stopped buying now and go to local independent?
859321269555375_374488431762228,KFC,"No one has ever gotten a bucket of kfc that looked like this. Maybe in the 90s. But these days, they’re passing starved chickens as drumsticks with 80% of the skin missing and two bites of meat at best. I miss the old kfc."
859321269555375_1380514119182864,KFC,Got a bucket and mine was not even half full.  KFC stop stuffing your bucket.  The legs are like chicken wings.  I get more chicken from the grocery store..
859321269555375_1167197254419796,KFC,"My family will never eat at a KFC again. We were treated so badly at the Zanesville Ohio KFC, on maple ave."
859321269555375_996620828473512,KFC,Remember when KFC had real chicken and not little capon chickens. Seems like everything has gotten bigger except chicken. They shrunk!
859321269555375_996712705160712,KFC,"I am still waiting to hear back from last week when I ordered it on the app. When I got there, they said they were out of chicken and would not make more--90 minutes before closing!!!! Give me my money back. Respond to my messages. What a disaster."
859321269555375_428448703378410,KFC,Got my BIG all thighs pieces yesterday at my request in person. Oh my oh my so good ! I can barely wait until next Tuesday.
859321269555375_1199383464554957,KFC,They used to have this too in Germany I don't know why it stop #KFC
859321269555375_1541104569772329,KFC,"This is painful to see. I love KFC, but Elko's KFC doesn't participate.  It's like a love letter from a girl who has a monster boyfriend.  So close,  yet so far away.  Sob."
859321269555375_332287689969985,KFC,He did not honor that 8 that that deal Stores not accepting
859321269555375_983812783254370,KFC,Should close their doors and call it.

859321269555375_755973540036181,KFC,I don't believe 8 pieces looks like that in any bucket I've gotten lately.....lol
859321269555375_474466008299183,KFC,Keep your high priced dark meat and small chicken. I used to eat there a lot but don’t anymore.
859321269555375_357809317406472,KFC,This is false advertising I was just charged 15.99!

859321269555375_3926012344353159,KFC,"Thats not 8, why do the build up the bucket to make it look like so much more?"
859321269555375_467387812443090,KFC,"Everyone just needs to boycott KFC and eat at Gunther’s Chicken, Popeyes Chicken, Slim Chicken ir Chic-fil-a.  Show KFC there are other chicken places"

859321269555375_984626083009540,KFC,"This is a HOAX, I went to my local KFC and they said it wasn’t offered.  Don’t be fooled it is just a ploy to get you into their restaurants then get you to order other items."
859321269555375_471867772063244,KFC,Only like wings n I did get to get 8 for 10
859321269555375_1332172864838619,KFC,"kfc went nasty about 10 years ago….size is dinky, taste like yesterdays leftovers, service sucks…..and it’s insulting they expect high dollar for they garbage"

859321269555375_983388193447315,KFC,"Went to KFC for the first time in a long time. I was utterly shocked at the prices. Too expensive. Who knew 4 small pieces of chicken/small Mac n cheese (cold), one biscuit cost over $20.00. Insanity. Will NOT BE BACK"
859321269555375_2645257158975041,KFC,KFC Masr 🍗 yummy
859321269555375_410305991877071,KFC,We like it but it getting over priced. Hell if it was measured like a womans breast it would be like if it was A breas . The wings could not fly and legs could not walk
859321269555375_980868833435280,KFC,I love KFC 🥰

851051183720166_431609546290244,McDonalds,"I misread that as ""taken out.""  Probably because it has 600 calories and *86* total grams of sugar.  Sheesh."
851051183720166_1857934951372458,McDonalds,It is so good!
851051183720166_995692035502627,McDonalds,Is the ice cream machine working?!

851051183720166_1098404127904065,McDonalds,Its not good at all
851051183720166_973528390857474,McDonalds,Our McDonald's has recently remodeled the store.  From parking lot up.  They're not reopened yet. I'll probably miss out on the Grandma McFlurry at the rate theyre going.
851051183720166_1235440100759304,McDonalds,Just had mine and it was so yummy 😋
851051183720166_976119254168347,McDonalds,Hey now. I resemble that remark 😂😂😂
851051183720166_331547503304457,McDonalds,Would love to have one but every McDonald's in my city has no icecream machine because it's been broken for over a year
851051183720166_1192783814980178,McDonalds,Hot date. Good for you
851051183720166_821644496499900,McDonalds,"I am a grandma now. Back in the day when McFlurries first came out, my kids were little. We couldn’t afford McDonald’s except for once a week, we would budget for a meal for each of us. It was a great day!  The kids wanted a McFlurry. Couldn’t afford that. The next week, I bought ice cream and M&M’s. I was determined my kids were going to have a McFlurry. I got the blender all set up, the ice cream out, and the M&M’s. I poured the M&M’s into the blender and turned it on. I forgot one small step. I didn’t put the lid on the blender. It was like a battle ground. M&Ms were flying every where!  Fun times. Lol"
851051183720166_1364447480915964,McDonalds,My kid won't eat it because he thinks it has pieces of grandma's in it.
851051183720166_416485844642934,McDonalds,Unless it has cookie pieces in it it's not a grandma mcflurry. Also the machine isn't broken they are just too lazy to call the guy that services the machine. The employees apparently are not allowed to clean it themselves.

851051183720166_989568472881720,McDonalds,What flavor is it
851051183720166_766170845666116,McDonalds,Do the “crunchy candy pieces” contain nuts?
851051183720166_7927313357289383,McDonalds,Bring back the little dog plushes from 2004 plss 😭
851051183720166_443345808395892,McDonalds,Does this mean the ice cream machines work again?
851051183720166_991201545733514,McDonalds,It would be so much better without the pieces of candy in it. I loved the butterscotch but overall it was too sweet.
851051183720166_2721661834650747,McDonalds,McDonald’s please bring back a grilled chicken sandwich.
851051183720166_3589217291327573,McDonalds,2.36 for a cheeseburger you are out of your mind
851051183720166_1029367825468248,McDonalds,Sooooo...it's a butterscotch mcflurry? They couldn't just call it that?
851051183720166_425011510343569,McDonalds,Is it made with real grandmas?
851051183720166_2811852932310617,McDonalds,"Unless it has crushed up hard candy from that dish that every granny has, it isn't a grandma McFlurry."
851051183720166_430953262891740,McDonalds,Did you find one with a working ice cream machine?
851051183720166_1505345673669901,McDonalds,My grandma will have a stroke if I give her McDonald’s
851051183720166_801949108239169,McDonalds,Wtf flavor is grandma
851051183720166_3757095157838368,McDonalds,"I just want the Reese’s McFlurry back, McDonald’s."
851051183720166_462665326176022,McDonalds,How come no matter which McDonald's you go to in this country how come the ice cream machine is always broken. The one in Cedartown across from Jack's I've been trying to get a grandma McFlurry for a couple of days here the machine is broke or they out of ice cream. I'm at the point now that I don't want it now.
851051183720166_497700842830169,McDonalds,I got the grandma McFlurry yesterday
851051183720166_451546554132110,McDonalds,Awesome!!
851051183720166_412476385016427,McDonalds,I heard it tastes like butterscotch 🤷🏼‍♀️ def sounds like a weird mcflurry but may just be good if everyone can get past the name of it 😂😂😂😂
851051183720166_1898527870582477,McDonalds,Bring back fried apple pies to the USA!
851051183720166_826579245525664,McDonalds,I'll take a super size Grandma Mcflurry please. 😂😋
851051183720166_1506948346869628,McDonalds,Does the Grandma McFlurry have nuts in it?
851051183720166_959204822651613,McDonalds,"Kool, can I get that at a price Grandma can afford?"
851051183720166_742238757824020,McDonalds,I liked the pretzel one more. This is way too sweet.
851051183720166_989457589234553,McDonalds,Wish my Nonni was alive. We would have def had a McFlurry date !
851051183720166_1483517159185396,McDonalds,It would be nice if it was posted what's in it! I asked at the driver thru and was told I honestly don't know!
851051183720166_1506661493606235,McDonalds,Is it really a McFlurry if they don’t even mix up the ingredients anymore? I just get a cup of soft serve with all toppings falling off because they don’t stir them anymore
851051183720166_7987341007966937,McDonalds,As a grandmother I'll say no. Your prices are way to high. We might as well go to a real restaurant (not fast food) somewhere and sit down and eat
851051183720166_1423522258330467,McDonalds,Will there be a working machine if i go?
851051183720166_831644458879023,McDonalds,Are all the ice cream machines working in all the stores now😂😂
851051183720166_991098556018083,McDonalds,"The first meal I bought someone was my Grandmother Jennie. I got a babysitting job and after I got paid I took her out to buy her lunch  We got too value meals but I was short, so she got a free coffee instead of a sofa. This was decades ago. And I am pretty sure I had under $10. Good memory."
851051183720166_2160657100935522,McDonalds,I'm still upset about the breakfast cinnamon rolls being discontinued 😭
851051183720166_738303285179663,McDonalds,"Does it include strawberry candy 
from the candy dish?"
851051183720166_1125678455314391,McDonalds,Liked it but a little too much butterscotch candy pieces. Would be better w granola or cookie crumbs.
851051183720166_430040499785226,McDonalds,It's butterscotch syrup and crumbles
851051183720166_1002698391463667,McDonalds,"Joe 'Jose' Hernandez It could also be a pending charge. I've had this concern with a lot of customers when I worked there. On Mcdoanlds side, on the screen there is a pay button on the screen. Unless if they push that to pay out the transaction on their end, it'll show as a pending transaction on your end and won't go back into your account for maybe a day to a few days. I would always explain this to those customers and told them if the charge does actually go through, to give my store a call then we could sort it out then. I think the reason why they said they couldn't do the refund was because if it said on their end you canceled it, or if they didn't press pay on their end then it would just be a pending charge and you would end up getting your money back in your account. So if they gave you the refund, then you would technically be getting more money back. I hope this makes sense ."
851051183720166_438950115547297,McDonalds,Is this cough drop flavored?Like the ones grandma used to give us instead of candy?
851051183720166_1384388435560648,McDonalds,Won't ever be eating one cuz the machine is always broken like grandma's hips
851051183720166_1644901876307735,McDonalds,"I had it yesterday, reminded me kind of like Butter finger smashed into ice cream and smothered in syrup"
851051183720166_1508174833103759,McDonalds,I went today. It wasn't my favorite. I had to try it though because butterscotch is so good.
851051183720166_420876900855631,McDonalds,It’s very good!!!
851051183720166_488104260447423,McDonalds,How about some snack wraps in snack wrap flavors?
851051183720166_369113118966114,McDonalds,"Grilled chicken or grilled chicken snack wrap!
With everything else fried, I can’t eat at McDonald’s"
851051183720166_789206366610971,McDonalds,I hope some grandmas  can get these and the machine won't be mcbroken when they get there.
851051183720166_1200940491342424,McDonalds,My grandma wasn't into butterscotch but she was into the strawberry candy
851051183720166_930232505542902,McDonalds,Did they get the right order?? And was the ice cream machine working??
851051183720166_1164962254539002,McDonalds,I like their food
851051183720166_370615276035459,McDonalds,Fried apple pies!!!!
851051183720166_988736642637237,McDonalds,For how long?    I missed it!!
851051183720166_8455584491137839,McDonalds,AI...because the machine is down.
851051183720166_7791842744209524,McDonalds,Ok. Anyway where are the snackwraps
851051183720166_1474338926510846,McDonalds,Why do they pull us up for everything now this is ridiculous
851051183720166_958852902588615,McDonalds,What’s the flavor ?
851051183720166_1146439639737009,McDonalds,I only eat the fries. Afraid I'll get Fed more rotten meat. 😭
851051183720166_7508698959177896,McDonalds,Moth ball flavored no doubt!
851051183720166_1924646831299142,McDonalds,Kinks and Cocktails is doing an episode about grandma's next and we will feature this mcflurry as our snack pairing! Thank you!
851051183720166_756162653351608,McDonalds,"We sell soooooo many of them. They taste fabulous and I enjoy making them while putting a little bit of my ""nanna"" touch to each ""grandma McFlurry!"" I'm able to make"
851051183720166_1575759839947559,McDonalds,Why does butterscotch gotta be associated with old folks. 🤨 I absolutely love butterscotch
851051183720166_753863726923701,McDonalds,"Grandma’s treat yourself, it’s wonderful!😊"
851051183720166_1935004930288301,McDonalds,Awesome!!
851051183720166_2460288814181299,McDonalds,"If my McDonald's had it I'd try it, but no guarantee their ice cream machine works (you seriously need a new machine vendor)."
851051183720166_1693725797825518,McDonalds,"It's good, had one last night"
851051183720166_500253485733880,McDonalds,Snack wraps
851051183720166_2767116696788472,McDonalds,OMG ITS MODERN DAY SOYLENT GREEN!
851051183720166_2117240281986986,McDonalds,"So, butterscotch lol. Sounds good!"
851051183720166_1715043892362984,McDonalds,I just ordered one in the app but got there and the ice cream machine was down. Imagine that McDonald's
851051183720166_367606412975082,McDonalds,What in it ??
851051183720166_974868693954440,McDonalds,It was so yummy! Better than purse candy!
851051183720166_1562990554433611,McDonalds,"I don't think we will be eating at McD any longer. The price of an extremely small sundae is now almost $9.00 which is about $7.00 too much. We know this is an independent owner who can pretty much set his own prices, but geez, that's crazy."
851051183720166_930459308765247,McDonalds,Oh nice another McFlurry I will never get to try because the machine is always “down” “broken” “waiting on the repair man”
851051183720166_339591768878498,McDonalds,What flavour is it?
851051183720166_1363249624347808,McDonalds,McD’s is counting on many to buy this McFlurry because most people will just have to “be in the know” about specific products so as to appear they know everything.
851051183720166_833519182028103,McDonalds,Man McDonald’s all I see is y’all avoiding the answer to question of WHAT CANDY specifically is in it as people do have allergies 😩
851051183720166_464024952964069,McDonalds,My grandma asked if we can go back to 2009 when the menu was better and there was actually grilled chicken and brownie melts.
851051183720166_2315043808699956,McDonalds,"Please have the mcflurry longer today, I was going to buy it but I forgot, I want to try it, it looks very delicious 🙏🙏🙏 please 😍🥰😋😋"
851051183720166_476701038089700,McDonalds,Chad Ray your mom needs one of these.
851051183720166_1011450107065648,McDonalds,"What is ""smooth syrup"" ?"
851051183720166_756964046593937,McDonalds,I know a lot of adults say they don’t like McDonald’s but kids do! I’m a grandma and I’m all about doing things that my grandkids enjoy. Off to McDonald’s we go!
851051183720166_469912412176741,McDonalds,Lauren Masapollo literally just snapped you about this

851051183720166_1663292024484417,McDonalds,Bring back fried apple pies!!!!
851051183720166_987352323018335,McDonalds,My grandma said f**k that shake where the snack wraps at
851051183720166_3730127150539445,McDonalds,Omg Mc Donald's I tried it!!!!! Ohhh the memories - there was a butterscotch plant next to our school in the 80's and we smelled it all day! Also Grandma's purse candy!!!! You gave this grandma lots of memories!!!
851051183720166_1188245665695490,McDonalds,Exactly what candy pieces I have 🤧allergies
851051183720166_855536333101036,McDonalds,Not sure why Mc Donald's is gatekeeping the candy and syrup... But it's butterscotch.
851051183720166_450878714154495,McDonalds,Given the 100% price increases since 2014 my grandma says she doesn't eat at #McDonalds anymore it's too expensive.
851051183720166_858711952943042,McDonalds,"I'm not a grandma but that's ok, I don't like butterscotch!"
851051183720166_1114832053156102,McDonalds,I would like a response to my application for McDonald's in kingwood West Virginia but no one wants to get back to me so yeah great job McDonald's corporate office really great job
851051183720166_819470213005568,McDonalds,I feel like everyone will become a Grandma and a Grandpa waiting for the Ice Cream machine to be working!
851051183720166_265491346591758,McDonalds,Grandma wants a free refill
851051183720166_413552994847188,McDonalds,My daughter said it looked like grandma pee. I thought it tasted like werthers original caramels
851051183720166_2246630289004849,McDonalds,I brought a strawberry Frappuccino from Starbucks today was good for the first few sips and then watery the rest of drink!  I want be wasting my money there again.  Sorry Macdonald I will be be getting my frappes from there from now on!
851051183720166_421289980699289,McDonalds,Which location did you go to? Can't ever seem to find one where the ice cream machine is working 😉
851051183720166_426115176715001,McDonalds,It’s butterscotch and vanilla you guys 😂😂
851051183720166_971968110905034,McDonalds,rip! worth it tho
851051183720166_687900753433677,McDonalds,I wish they would bring back yougart parfait  again soo good for a dollar
851051183720166_424804846983971,McDonalds,I tried a Grandma McFlurry and it’s delicious
851051183720166_315514471595516,McDonalds,Are they made with real Grandmas?
851051183720166_4624179541157545,McDonalds,McDonald's  Why can't we have the BBQ chipotle snack wrap and the Mulan szechuan sauce back?? 😭😭
851051183720166_3819972881620413,McDonalds,Drinking this will turn you into a grandma
851051183720166_466490242423607,McDonalds,What flavors are in a grandma Mc Flurry
851051183720166_1150710292748560,McDonalds,"Hate to drive up to pay, then pull forward to receive order to be told to pull into a parking space to wait indefinately. What ever happened to first come first served?"
851051183720166_472416018592488,McDonalds,That sounds morbid af o..o
851051183720166_410608685277913,McDonalds,"Would be great if any McDonalds still actually blended a McFlurry….

Can’t remember the last time I had a McFlurry where it wasn’t just vanilla ice cream with whatever topping on it… can’t even remember the last time I’ve gotten one of the mixing spoons…."
851051183720166_1020763592863121,McDonalds,"Got mine on Sunday!! 💖 Always Get Dessert XOXO, Grandma ￼"
851051183720166_987737809522275,McDonalds,It is worth going to Japan just to enjoy a Teriyaki Big Mac - and only $3. Too bad they're not available here.
851051183720166_768453875087088,McDonalds,"I had it the other day, it was amazing. 

But 

Imagine the endless possibilities if McDonald's took a bold leap and shared the magic of their iconic fries and cookies beyond their golden arches. By bringing their beloved treats to more locations (Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, etc.), they could spread joy and satisfaction to even more people, making every shopping trip a delightful experience. It's not just about selling food; it's about spreading happiness wherever hunger strikes. Not only that, but they would rake in even more dough, which allows them to pay their employees better, and lower the costs of their food. It's a win/win for the business and its consumers!"
851051183720166_980039163610697,McDonalds,"Bring back dollar menu for folks, I sure can’t afford McDonald’s nothing like I used too🙃"
851051183720166_819630422938781,McDonalds,Butterscotch is the flavor with ￼ butterscotch candy pieces.
851051183720166_934336581708398,McDonalds,"It's like...it brings to mind fuzzy candy, hair, and  old Kleenex..."
851051183720166_362733323458197,McDonalds,This grandma of six will pass on it
851051183720166_376774964793893,McDonalds,I’ll take my homecare client to get one (:
851051183720166_1203101804461572,McDonalds,What about grimace shakes?
851051183720166_432140956124966,McDonalds,Wtf is my yogurt parfait s mf
851051183720166_821414029433349,McDonalds,"Absolutely AWFUL.  You will never convince me this wasn't on purpose.  Still 2 hours before they closed, I ordered 2 mcdoubles on the app with NO PICKLE, NO ONIONS.  What did I get?  2 mcdoubles with EXTRA PICKLES AND EXTRA ONIONS.  There is no way this was an honest mistake.  Not when the specific wrote it on the wrapper as extra pickles and extra onions.  That's not a mistake, that was on purpose.  My email receipt clearly says no pickle, no onion, for the wrapper to say extra pickle and extra onion is no mistake, that was intentional.  Fries were cold and mushy.  Just awful all around."
851051183720166_368715469068318,McDonalds,They would not honor the buy one get one deal. 40 cents more c'mon. Charge us for the more expensive one and give us the cheaper one for free.
851051183720166_1167981794328256,McDonalds,too much opinion

851051183720166_842579561075749,McDonalds,"Do these grandma’s get a senior discount for the McFlurry? Cause they should!

Or maybe we should honor grandparents by bringing prices down to what they used to be so they can afford them (and us to) as CEOs/shareholders don’t need the money/profit margins, the employees do and costs have not increased THAT MUCH to justify the inflation…💅"

851051183720166_387727350266825,McDonalds,"In this text I will destroy cern, I will prove that it does not work, i.e. if there are two magnets in the accelerator and both have the same magnetic force, the proton located next to the first magnet will be attracted to it because this magnet has a stronger effect on it than the second magnet, so in accelerator, the proton stands next to the first magnet and does not fly to the second one and is attracted to the first magnet. Secondly, when you make an electromagnet and pour iron filings around it, no filings fly from the left side of the electromagnet to the right side because they would transfer all the filings to the left side of the electromagnet to the right and this is not the case and therefore there is no force in the electromagnet to make the filing or proton move forward in the accelerator tube, and it is observed that the filings around the electromagnet are deposited evenly and do not fly forward with the current but are attracted to it by tracing the pattern of the electromagnet's magnetic field, so the proton in the accelerator would stick to the electromagnet, i.e. to the housing. And at Cern they lie with the test results, so shame, shame, shame and burn yourself with shame for being so stupid. Sensors only measure electrostatic discharges, not proton impacts. And in order to make a cyclotron, electromagnets must be placed on the appropriate sides around the cyclotron, and the first magnet must be the weakest, and next to it there must be a second, stronger one, and an even stronger electromagnet shakes, and repeat the electromagnets, then you can obtain the forward momentum of the atom or proton."

The little candies, whatever they are, are actually really good, they are crunchy but not sticky and a mix of toffee and butterscotch I think. Or perhaps just toffee and the butterscotch is just what's in the ice cream, I don't know. I think some people are going to have hang-ups about the name. Personally I think they should drizzle a little hot fudge on top and call it a Scotch-a-Roo McFlurry! I think that would be an amazing and descriptive name! Not everybody has a sweet Grandma who gives them butterscotch candies and Heath bars. Personally I did, and even my mom is that, but I am now a 61-year-old grandma . I do not carry butterscotches but I often have Jelly Bellies or gum or something for the kids. 600 calories though scares any self-respecting grandmother away! Especially for themselves. All that sugar (86g?) I actually shouldn't be eating it but I had to give it a try. That's enough sugar for a week for me. I have high blood sugar."

851051183720166_1834583737035603,McDonalds,"GRAVITY. why is it, as Galileo discovered, that two bodies with different masses fall to the earth at the same time when they are dropped from the same height,.this is because gravity acts only over a small distance, for example 3 kilometers, so for example I would assume that gravity acts on the 10 closest atoms, i.e. bodies with two different masses fall at the same time, in the first case when the body is lighter than the second and consists of consists of 2 atoms, then the force of 8 atoms from the earth acts on them so that the state of the number of atoms is preserved as long as the force of gravity acts and the resultant mass that I throw onto the earth and the mass of the earth is 10 (the body being dropped is 2 atoms and the mass of the earth is 8 atoms because gravity acts on 10 atoms) and in the second case, when I drop a body from the same height to the ground, it has 3 atoms, so that the gravitational constant would be preserved, how many atoms does gravity affect, the earth will attract this body with 7 of its atoms, so that there would be a constant of 10 atoms per what is the effect of the force of gravity and the resultant force of the dropped force, i.e. 3, and by how many atoms the body is attracted by the earth, 7 atoms is equal to 10. So in both cases, when I throw a lighter body and a heavier one onto the ground, two different forces of attraction of the earth act on them. the smaller body is affected by the greater gravitational force of the earth, and the larger body is affected by the smaller gravitational force of the earth atom, and each time there is the same resultant force attracting both these masses and therefore there is a constant acceleration. and to what extent one atom affects other atoms with the gravitational force, we can it is easy to check and it depends on how many meters the ball will accelerate on the inclined plane, because after reaching the distance affected by one atom, the ball will roll down with uniform motion, simply, as many meters as the ball accelerates, it will act on the number of atoms with the gravitational force for the rest of the atoms and about a kilometer, I guess, because then the ball will roll down an inclined plane with uniform motion, which I explain in the video about gravity on my You Tube channel boze jehowa nauka Jarek Lichwala.., and more specifically about gravity, I will record a video for the You Tube channel boze jehowa jarek nauka ,.FREE ELECTRONS, it was not well researched that there are free electrons, because by taking a vial, a glass bulb and passing a current through it, an electric arc will be caused in it, and when I put a magnet to it, it will bend in the magnetic field and there were atoms in this glass bulb and not electrons, because the same effect is the deflection of the electric arc on atoms when I create a vacuum in the bubble, because there will be atoms there anyway, and the impact of the deflection of the electric arc through magnets takes place on atoms, not electrons, and in order to obtain electrons, you need to destroy the atom with a voltage and then obtain the powder of electrons is red and protons is blue, and voltage is the force that is established first when electric current flows, and this is the distance between one atom and another and this force that expands and breaks atoms into elementary particles,and the proof of this is the impact force that when a bomb explodes, it tears apart a person in a spacesuit, and this tension tears a person apart,,,,FREE ENERGY. to obtain free energy from a magnet and germanium, you need to make an alloy of these two atoms and then in such a magnet made of germanium and magnesium there are two different magnetic forces: at the top there is a stronger magnetic field, at the bottom there is a weaker magnetic field and there is a potential difference between them two forces and when we wind a winding on such a magnet, an electric current will flow under the influence of the potential difference. When such magnesium is poured, there is usually greater magnetism at the top and less at the bottom and it is possible to fly on it in startreks and to make this magnet even more useful for this then you need to wind a winding on it and connect it to the current and additionally apply a second voltage to the winding, then the domains will jump exactly to the beginnings of metallicity, just like in a thyristor, sometimes it conducts current, sometimes it doesn't, and a magnet will be created, there will be a strong magnetic field at the top and there will be no magnetic field at the bottom. , a single-polar magnet will be created, and for the alloy to work for free energy, it must be cast properly in the north-south direction, and it is cast differently for China and differently for Poland in its territory,,and about how to pour stop for free energy I have videos on your YouTube channel boze jehowa nauka Jarek Lichwala and there will be new ones about this issue boze jehowa jarek nauka"

851051183720166_741045788105638,McDonalds,Kinda cringey.
851051183720166_1606314660204902,McDonalds,"Ordered one on the app, paid for it, got to the location, and was told the ice cream machine wasn't working. So paid $5 for nothing."
851051183720166_814102190220038,McDonalds,"McDonald's I took my Grandma to get a grandma mcflurry, but she ended up in the ER from a food allergy, because you guys wouldn't tell anyone what was in it. You just kept saying, you have to try it to find out. She definitely found out!"
851051183720166_1369690727757078,McDonalds,So this is made from real grandmas like the girl scout cookies in the addams family movie? Lol

851051183720166_459596913233319,McDonalds,"You really shouldn’t advertise these Grandma McFlurry’s at the locations that don’t have them . 

I went to 3 McDonald’s in my area & all 3 said “ they never got them in “ but they advertise them !!

SHAME ON MCDONALDS !!"
851051183720166_766133475637105,McDonalds,At this point the ice cream is prolly fake too.
851051183720166_796204382702936,McDonalds,"Now, no more ""free"" refill's?"
851051183720166_760156852944915,McDonalds,"No, because that would mean that there's actually a McDonald's with a WORKING ICE CREAM MACHINE!!!"
851051183720166_486272500407934,McDonalds,McDonald's my grandmas loved your fried cherry pie. Can you bring those back instead or a mcflurry that taste like the cherry pies? This grandma mcflurry almost broke my tooth and I'm not even a grandma yet. Yikes. Hope no one else grandma broke a tooth or hurt their mouth eating this.
851051183720166_834531091896587,McDonalds,Sounds too expensive
851051183720166_1106194054003629,McDonalds,This grandma doesn't like butterscotch

851051183720166_458853286834150,McDonalds,Anything to get Grandma to come in with her grand kids. But $6.00 for a McFlurry that's insane. I'll pass.

851051183720166_1163922555031644,McDonalds,Definitely not worth the $5 birthday splurge I just gave myself 🥴
851051183720166_418842694444714,McDonalds,Does it taste like the piece of candy in grandma’s purse that fell out of the plastic and rolled around collecting dust and she gives you if you behave flavor?
851051183720166_849573080318067,McDonalds,"Having trouble selling overpriced dry, cardboard cheeseburgers and cold tasteless fries, so you have to try to get people in the door with a mystery flavored milkshake. LOL"
851051183720166_793812389123601,McDonalds,I doubt any McDonald's has a working mcflurry machine to even try.
851051183720166_427560560027496,McDonalds,"So, nobody in this comment thread works for McDonald's?! Just tell us the flavor 😭"

However, whenever I try to use them, I am always told that they don’t honor coupons.  The coupons do mention that they are valid at “participating locations”. But it seems like no location is participating! I’ve looked online to find out which locations honor coupons but could not find it.  Please let me know where I can find the list of participating locations.  Honestly, this coupon business seems like a scam to atteact people to go buy at Subway thinking they’ll get a deal but no deal is given.  Now when I get to the cash and am told that they don’t accept coupons, I just walk away and the restaurant is stuck with a sub already made. I encourage everyone to do that in order to put pressure on Subway to change their very unethical coupon practice."

844604394371417_987521816165273,Subway,"Has any tried to use subway coupons they receive in mailers? I tried this past weekend and was told this is only for participating subways and we are not participating. Well how do I know that the only participating subway isn’t in Anchorage Alaska?

This marketing strategy is absolutely deceiving. Tricking people into purchasing food. They think they are going to pay one price and end up paying way more. 

The coupon I had was 2 footings for 13.99. I thought that was a fair price. I go out to check out and because this subway wasn’t participating I end up paying 28!

It is absolutely ridiculous that subway willingly sends me coupons that I cannot use at my local subway. Then doesn’t even provide a list of participating subways. 

I have reached out multiple times about this issue and have not heard anything. So not only are they deceitful but their customer services is lacking as well."
