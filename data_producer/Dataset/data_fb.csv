859321269555375_2439446119576883,KFC,Just bought the Tuesday 10 piece bucket. Got home only 8 pieces. Tried to call no answer. MSG box full. Ck your to go orders before you leave here. I got shorted and could not reach anyone. I‚Äôm done with businesses that don‚Äôt honor their offers
859321269555375_428728783271688,KFC,Chambersburg KFC stated it has to be ordered on line to get the Tuesday deals.  Said thank you and drove out of the drive thru.  Went to Popeyes up the street.
859321269555375_443277768325287,KFC,Looks nothing like that when you get it
859321269555375_394041866950334,KFC,"The last 2 times I have eaten it, it was too salty. Wish they would cut down on that a little"
859321269555375_425465623704835,KFC,That's a 20 piece bucket
859321269555375_453099657301300,KFC,"My dad used to take us to kfc on Sunday‚Äôs and he could buy a full bucket, drinks and fries for the 5 of us for about $ 15.00 and even after eating a lot we would have left overs!! It‚Äôs crazy how small and dinky their chicken is nowadays!! Over priced too!"
859321269555375_850388630442557,KFC,"Those buckets are misleading. You don‚Äôt get that much. Back in the day, those buckets were packed full"
859321269555375_962366312041286,KFC,"That's an easy rule to comply with. I'm in no rush to eat dark meat chicken. Thus, pro tip#2, women and children first."
859321269555375_1927088541060235,KFC,Ashland Va didn't Honor it.  I will never go there again
859321269555375_681000447488242,KFC,I‚Äôve had it three times. First time was 2 breast and 2 thighs and 2 legs. It was great. The other times they tried to screw me with a bunch of legs and wings üò°
859321269555375_428045840019413,KFC,Tried it last night. 8 pieces for $10 is a pretty good deal. Got home and the bucket had 4 drumsticks and 4 thighs. No breasts or wings. Your big TV ad didn't mention that. Last time I'll  buy from KFC.
859321269555375_444246561884150,KFC,Never get pieces of chicken like that and never any breast like we used to get. All you get now is minute legs and a wing with a smallest piece of breast. Stopped buying now and go to local independent?
859321269555375_374488431762228,KFC,"No one has ever gotten a bucket of kfc that looked like this. Maybe in the 90s. But these days, they‚Äôre passing starved chickens as drumsticks with 80% of the skin missing and two bites of meat at best. I miss the old kfc."
859321269555375_1380514119182864,KFC,Got a bucket and mine was not even half full.  KFC stop stuffing your bucket.  The legs are like chicken wings.  I get more chicken from the grocery store..
859321269555375_1167197254419796,KFC,"My family will never eat at a KFC again. We were treated so badly at the Zanesville Ohio KFC, on maple ave."
859321269555375_996620828473512,KFC,Remember when KFC had real chicken and not little capon chickens. Seems like everything has gotten bigger except chicken. They shrunk!
859321269555375_996712705160712,KFC,"I am still waiting to hear back from last week when I ordered it on the app. When I got there, they said they were out of chicken and would not make more--90 minutes before closing!!!! Give me my money back. Respond to my messages. What a disaster."
859321269555375_428448703378410,KFC,Got my BIG all thighs pieces yesterday at my request in person. Oh my oh my so good ! I can barely wait until next Tuesday.

851051183720166_821644496499900,McDonalds,"I am a grandma now. Back in the day when McFlurries first came out, my kids were little. We couldn‚Äôt afford McDonald‚Äôs except for once a week, we would budget for a meal for each of us. It was a great day!  The kids wanted a McFlurry. Couldn‚Äôt afford that. The next week, I bought ice cream and M&M‚Äôs. I was determined my kids were going to have a McFlurry. I got the blender all set up, the ice cream out, and the M&M‚Äôs. I poured the M&M‚Äôs into the blender and turned it on. I forgot one small step. I didn‚Äôt put the lid on the blender. It was like a battle ground. M&Ms were flying every where!  Fun times. Lol"

This last time we were told to pull up to the next window sat there for 30 minutes, decided to go inside & our food was just sitting there on the counter. Tried to talk to a worker/manager and no one even acknowledged us."

851051183720166_1506661493606235,McDonalds,Is it really a McFlurry if they don‚Äôt even mix up the ingredients anymore? I just get a cup of soft serve with all toppings falling off because they don‚Äôt stir them anymore
851051183720166_7987341007966937,McDonalds,As a grandmother I'll say no. Your prices are way to high. We might as well go to a real restaurant (not fast food) somewhere and sit down and eat

851051183720166_430040499785226,McDonalds,It's butterscotch syrup and crumbles
851051183720166_1002698391463667,McDonalds,"Joe 'Jose' Hernandez It could also be a pending charge. I've had this concern with a lot of customers when I worked there. On Mcdoanlds side, on the screen there is a pay button on the screen. Unless if they push that to pay out the transaction on their end, it'll show as a pending transaction on your end and won't go back into your account for maybe a day to a few days. I would always explain this to those customers and told them if the charge does actually go through, to give my store a call then we could sort it out then. I think the reason why they said they couldn't do the refund was because if it said on their end you canceled it, or if they didn't press pay on their end then it would just be a pending charge and you would end up getting your money back in your account. So if they gave you the refund, then you would technically be getting more money back. I hope this makes sense ."
851051183720166_438950115547297,McDonalds,Is this cough drop flavored?Like the ones grandma used to give us instead of candy?

851051183720166_450878714154495,McDonalds,Given the 100% price increases since 2014 my grandma says she doesn't eat at #McDonalds anymore it's too expensive.

851051183720166_768453875087088,McDonalds,"I had it the other day, it was amazing. 

But 

Imagine the endless possibilities if McDonald's took a bold leap and shared the magic of their iconic fries and cookies beyond their golden arches. By bringing their beloved treats to more locations (Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, etc.), they could spread joy and satisfaction to even more people, making every shopping trip a delightful experience. It's not just about selling food; it's about spreading happiness wherever hunger strikes. Not only that, but they would rake in even more dough, which allows them to pay their employees better, and lower the costs of their food. It's a win/win for the business and its consumers!"

Still 2 hours before they closed, I ordered 2 mcdoubles on the app with NO PICKLE, NO ONIONS.  What did I get?  2 mcdoubles with EXTRA PICKLES AND EXTRA ONIONS.  There is no way this was an honest mistake.  Not when the specific wrote it on the wrapper as extra pickles and extra onions.  That's not a mistake, that was on purpose.  My email receipt clearly says no pickle, no onion, for the wrapper to say extra pickle and extra onion is no mistake, that was intentional.  Fries were cold and mushy.  Just awful all around."

851051183720166_387727350266825,McDonalds,"In this text I will destroy cern, I will prove that it does not work, i.e. if there are two magnets in the accelerator and both have the same magnetic force, the proton located next to the first magnet will be attracted to it because this magnet has a stronger effect on it than the second magnet, so in accelerator, the proton stands next to the first magnet and does not fly to the second one and is attracted to the first magnet. Secondly, when you make an electromagnet and pour iron filings around it, no filings fly from the left side of the electromagnet to the right side because they would transfer all the filings to the left side of the electromagnet to the right and this is not the case and therefore there is no force in the electromagnet to make the filing or proton move forward in the accelerator tube, and it is observed that the filings around the electromagnet are deposited evenly and do not fly forward with the current but are attracted to it by tracing the pattern of the electromagnet's magnetic field, so the proton in the accelerator would stick to the electromagnet, i.e. to the housing. And at Cern they lie with the test results, so shame, shame, shame and burn yourself with shame for being so stupid. Sensors only measure electrostatic discharges, not proton impacts. And in order to make a cyclotron, electromagnets must be placed on the appropriate sides around the cyclotron, and the first magnet must be the weakest, and next to it there must be a second, stronger one, and an even stronger electromagnet shakes, and repeat the electromagnets, then you can obtain the forward momentum of the atom or proton."

851051183720166_1162158498242774,McDonalds,"I thought it was amazing, but I added whipped cream and caramel sauce to mine and that was even better! The little candies, whatever they are, are actually really good, they are crunchy but not sticky and a mix of toffee and butterscotch I think. Or perhaps just toffee and the butterscotch is just what's in the ice cream, I don't know. I think some people are going to have hang-ups about the name. Personally I think they should drizzle a little hot fudge on top and call it a Scotch-a-Roo McFlurry! I think that would be an amazing and descriptive name! Not everybody has a sweet Grandma who gives them butterscotch candies and Heath bars. Personally I did, and even my mom is that, but I am now a 61-year-old grandma . I do not carry butterscotches but I often have Jelly Bellies or gum or something for the kids. 600 calories though scares any self-respecting grandmother away! Especially for themselves. All that sugar (86g?) I actually shouldn't be eating it but I had to give it a try. That's enough sugar for a week for me. I have high blood sugar."

851051183720166_1834583737035603,McDonalds,"GRAVITY. why is it, as Galileo discovered, that two bodies with different masses fall to the earth at the same time when they are dropped from the same height,.this is because gravity acts only over a small distance, for example 3 kilometers, so for example I would assume that gravity acts on the 10 closest atoms, i.e. bodies with two different masses fall at the same time, in the first case when the body is lighter than the second and consists of consists of 2 atoms, then the force of 8 atoms from the earth acts on them so that the state of the number of atoms is preserved as long as the force of gravity acts and the resultant mass that I throw onto the earth and the mass of the earth is 10 (the body being dropped is 2 atoms and the mass of the earth is 8 atoms because gravity acts on 10 atoms) and in the second case, when I drop a body from the same height to the ground, it has 3 atoms, so that the gravitational constant would be preserved, how many atoms does gravity affect, the earth will attract this body with 7 of its atoms, so that there would be a constant of 10 atoms per what is the effect of the force of gravity and the resultant force of the dropped force, i.e. 3, and by how many atoms the body is attracted by the earth, 7 atoms is equal to 10. So in both cases, when I throw a lighter body and a heavier one onto the ground, two different forces of attraction of the earth act on them. the smaller body is affected by the greater gravitational force of the earth, and the larger body is affected by the smaller gravitational force of the earth atom, and each time there is the same resultant force attracting both these masses and therefore there is a constant acceleration. and to what extent one atom affects other atoms with the gravitational force, we can it is easy to check and it depends on how many meters the ball will accelerate on the inclined plane, because after reaching the distance affected by one atom, the ball will roll down with uniform motion, simply, as many meters as the ball accelerates, it will act on the number of atoms with the gravitational force for the rest of the atoms and about a kilometer, I guess, because then the ball will roll down an inclined plane with uniform motion, which I explain in the video about gravity on my You Tube channel boze jehowa nauka Jarek Lichwala.., and more specifically about gravity, I will record a video for the You Tube channel boze jehowa jarek nauka ,.FREE ELECTRONS, it was not well researched that there are free electrons, because by taking a vial, a glass bulb and passing a current through it, an electric arc will be caused in it, and when I put a magnet to it, it will bend in the magnetic field and there were atoms in this glass bulb and not electrons, because the same effect is the deflection of the electric arc on atoms when I create a vacuum in the bubble, because there will be atoms there anyway, and the impact of the deflection of the electric arc through magnets takes place on atoms, not electrons, and in order to obtain electrons, you need to destroy the atom with a voltage and then obtain the powder of electrons is red and protons is blue, and voltage is the force that is established first when electric current flows, and this is the distance between one atom and another and this force that expands and breaks atoms into elementary particles,and the proof of this is the impact force that when a bomb explodes, it tears apart a person in a spacesuit, and this tension tears a person apart,,,,FREE ENERGY. to obtain free energy from a magnet and germanium, you need to make an alloy of these two atoms and then in such a magnet made of germanium and magnesium there are two different magnetic forces: at the top there is a stronger magnetic field, at the bottom there is a weaker magnetic field and there is a potential difference between them two forces and when we wind a winding on such a magnet, an electric current will flow under the influence of the potential difference. When such magnesium is poured, there is usually greater magnetism at the top and less at the bottom and it is possible to fly on it in startreks and to make this magnet even more useful for this then you need to wind a winding on it and connect it to the current and additionally apply a second voltage to the winding, then the domains will jump exactly to the beginnings of metallicity, just like in a thyristor, sometimes it conducts current, sometimes it doesn't, and a magnet will be created, there will be a strong magnetic field at the top and there will be no magnetic field at the bottom. , a single-polar magnet will be created, and for the alloy to work for free energy, it must be cast properly in the north-south direction, and it is cast differently for China and differently for Poland in its territory,,and about how to pour stop for free energy I have videos on your YouTube channel boze jehowa nauka Jarek Lichwala and there will be new ones about this issue boze jehowa jarek nauka"

But it seems like no location is participating! I‚Äôve looked online to find out which locations honor coupons but could not find it.  Please let me know where I can find the list of participating locations.  Honestly, this coupon business seems like a scam to atteact people to go buy at Subway thinking they‚Äôll get a deal but no deal is given.  Now when I get to the cash and am told that they don‚Äôt accept coupons, I just walk away and the restaurant is stuck with a sub already made.

This marketing strategy is absolutely deceiving. Tricking people into purchasing food. They think they are going to pay one price and end up paying way more. 

The coupon I had was 2 footings for 13.99. I thought that was a fair price. I go out to check out and because this subway wasn‚Äôt participating I end up paying 28!

It is absolutely ridiculous that subway willingly sends me coupons that I cannot use at my local subway. Then doesn‚Äôt even provide a list of participating subways. 

I have reached out multiple times about this issue and have not heard anything. So not only are they deceitful but their customer services is lacking as well."
